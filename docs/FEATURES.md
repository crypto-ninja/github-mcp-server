## 🎯 Advanced Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Technology Stack Analysis
```
Claude Conversation:
User: "I want to build a web scraping tool. Find me the top 3 Python 
web scraping libraries on GitHub and compare their features."

Claude uses:
1. github_search_repositories (query: "web scraping language:python")
2. github_get_repo_info (for each top result)
3. github_get_file_content (to read README files)

Result: Comprehensive comparison with stars, features, and use cases
```

### Scenario 2: Bug Investigation Workflow
```
User: "Help me understand the performance issues in the React 
repository. Find related open issues."

Claude uses:
1. github_list_issues (owner: "facebook", repo: "react", state: "open")
2. Filters for issues with "performance" label
3. github_get_repo_info (to understand project context)

Result: List of performance-related issues with analysis
```

### Scenario 3: Developer Research
```
User: "Who are the most active contributors to the Linux kernel?"

Claude uses:
1. github_get_repo_info (owner: "torvalds", repo: "linux")
2. github_list_pull_requests (to see recent contributions)
3. github_get_user_info (for top contributors)

Result: Profile analysis of key contributors
```

### Scenario 4: Project Setup
```

## 💡 Power User Tips

### Tip 1: Chain Multiple Queries
```
"Find Python machine learning repos with >10k stars, then get the 
README from the top result and summarize the key features"
```
Claude will automatically use multiple tools in sequence.

### Tip 2: Use Advanced Search Syntax
```
query: "language:rust stars:>5000 created:>2023-01-01 fork:false"
```
Combine multiple criteria for precise results.

### Tip 3: Paginate Through Large Results
```
page: 1  # First 20 results
page: 2  # Next 20 results
page: 3  # And so on...
```

### Tip 4: Monitor Specific Repositories
```
"Create a daily summary of issues created in tensorflow/tensorflow 
in the last 24 hours"
```

### Tip 5: Research Workflows
```
"Compare the three most popular JavaScript frameworks on GitHub 
by stars, activity, and community size"
```
